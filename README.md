A Pacman clone written in C99 with minimal dependencies for Windows, macOS, Linux and WASM.
On Mac and Linux this will create an executable called 'pacman' in the build directory.
You'll run into various problems running the Emscripten SDK tools on Windows, might be better to run this stuff in WSL.
